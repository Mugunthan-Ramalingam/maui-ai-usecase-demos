# AI-Powered Smart Filter in .NET MAUI ComboBox

This sample demonstrates AI-powered smart filtering with the Syncfusion® .NET MAUI ComboBox. The application integrates Azure OpenAI to understand natural language search queries and intelligently suggest matching items.

## Overview

Traditional filtering relies on exact text matching, which can make it difficult to discover relevant items when users use natural language descriptions, incomplete keywords, or spelling variations.

This sample uses Azure OpenAI to intelligently analyze user input and identify the most relevant matches from a collection of items.

The AI-powered filtering engine considers:

- Natural language search terms
- Spelling variations and corrections
- Semantic meaning of the search query
- Related item names
- Contextual relevance
- User intent

For example, users can search using phrases such as:

```text
healthy snacks

something spicy

italian food

burger with cheese
```

Azure OpenAI interprets the meaning behind the search query and returns the most relevant items.

The filtered results are displayed directly in the Syncfusion® .NET MAUI ComboBox, providing a more intelligent and user-friendly search experience.

## Output
