# AI-Powered Dynamic Form Generation in .NET MAUI DataForm

This sample demonstrates AI-powered dynamic form generation with the Syncfusion® .NET MAUI DataForm. The application integrates Azure OpenAI to analyze free-text user input, identify meaningful fields, and automatically generate a fully editable form at runtime.

## Overview

Creating forms manually can be time-consuming when the structure depends on user requirements. This sample uses Azure OpenAI to intelligently interpret unstructured text and transform it into a structured form definition.

The AI-powered form generation engine analyzes:

- Field names
- Field values
- Data types
- Missing field information
- User intent
- Form structure

Based on the AI response, corresponding DataForm editors are created dynamically in the Syncfusion® .NET MAUI DataForm.

For example, if the user enters:

```text
Name John
Age 28
Email john@example.com
Phone
```

The AI generates appropriate DataForm fields for:

- Name
- Age
- Email
- Phone

Fields with missing values remain editable so users can complete the information later.

The generated form is displayed directly in the Syncfusion® .NET MAUI DataForm, allowing users to review and modify the generated content.

## Key Features

- Syncfusion® .NET MAUI DataForm integration
- Azure OpenAI-powered form generation
- Dynamic field creation from natural language input
- Automatic field type detection
- Editable generated forms
- Support for text, number, email, and phone fields
- Intelligent value extraction
- Handling incomplete user data
- Runtime DataForm item generation
- Cross-platform .NET MAUI application

## Sample

```xml
<dataform:SfDataForm
    x:Name="dataForm"
    AutoGenerateItems="False"
    ValidationMode="PropertyChanged"
    LayoutType="TextInputLayout">

    <dataform:SfDataForm.TextInputLayoutSettings>
        <dataform:TextInputLayoutSettings
            ShowHelperText="True"/>
    </dataform:SfDataForm.TextInputLayoutSettings>

</dataform:SfDataForm>
```

## Output

The AI-generated response is converted into DataForm items and rendered dynamically.

Example input:

```text
Name John
Age 28
Email john@example.com
Phone
```

Generated form:

```text
Name     : John
Age      : 28
Email    : john@example.com
Phone    :
```

Users can continue editing the generated fields directly from the DataForm.
