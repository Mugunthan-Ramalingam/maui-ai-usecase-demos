# AI-Powered Tag Generator in .NET MAUI

This sample demonstrates AI-powered tag generation with the Syncfusion .NET MAUI Chips control. The application integrates Azure OpenAI to turn a natural-language description into relevant, context-aware tags that can be displayed as clean chip items.

## Overview

Tag generation is useful in content workflows, feature planning, and product discovery scenarios where users describe intent and need a short, structured set of keywords. This sample uses Azure OpenAI to interpret the description and return only tags from a curated vocabulary, so the results remain accurate, consistent, and UI-friendly.

The AI-generated tags are displayed as chips with a polished loading state and a wrap layout that supports multiple rows without clipping. This makes the sample useful as a reference for smart labeling, content classification, and metadata suggestions inside MAUI applications.

## Key Features

- Syncfusion .NET MAUI Chips integration
- Azure OpenAI-powered tag generation
- Vocabulary-constrained output for valid chip labels
- Case-insensitive parsing with canonical tag names and duplicate removal
- Up to 12 accepted tags per response
- Natural-language input for feature and content descriptions
- Loading, empty, and results states in the UI
- Wrapping chip layout for responsive display
- Clear and regenerate workflow for repeated prompts
- Cross-platform .NET MAUI application

## Sample

```xaml
<syncfusion:SfChipGroup Grid.Row="0"
    x:Name="chipsControl"
    ItemsSource="{Binding Tags}"
    DisplayMemberPath="Name"
    ChipType="Action"
    ChipBackground="{StaticResource BrandAccent}"
    ChipTextColor="White"
    HorizontalOptions="Fill"
    VerticalOptions="Start">
    <syncfusion:SfChipGroup.ChipLayout>
        <FlexLayout Direction="Row"
                    Wrap="Wrap"
                    JustifyContent="Start"
                    AlignItems="Start"/>
    </syncfusion:SfChipGroup.ChipLayout>
</syncfusion:SfChipGroup>
```

## AI integration

`AzureOpenAITagService` uses Azure.AI.OpenAI 2.1.0. It creates an `AzureOpenAIClient`, gets the configured chat deployment, and sends system and user messages with `CompleteChatAsync`. Cancellation is passed through to the SDK. Authentication, missing-deployment, and empty-response errors are surfaced to the view model and shown in the UI.

The system prompt constrains the model to `TagVocabulary`. The view model then validates each returned line against that vocabulary, canonicalizes names, removes duplicates, and limits the displayed results to 12 tags.

## Azure OpenAI setup

The endpoint, deployment name, and API key are configured in `SmartAITags/SmartAITags/AIService/AzureOpenAITagService.cs`. Rotate any key that has been committed, and never commit credentials. This sample calls Azure OpenAI directly from the MAUI client, so a packaged app can expose a bundled key. Use a secured backend service to protect credentials in production.

The project targets .NET 10 and uses the Azure.AI.OpenAI 2.1.0 NuGet package.

- Valid Syncfusion license key

## Troubleshooting

### Path too long exception

If you encounter a "Path Too Long" exception while building the project, close Visual Studio, rename the repository folder to a shorter name, and rebuild the project.
