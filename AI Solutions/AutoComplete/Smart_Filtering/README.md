# AI-Powered Smart Filter in .NET MAUI AutoComplete

This sample demonstrates AI-powered smart filtering with the Syncfusion® .NET MAUI AutoComplete. The application integrates Azure OpenAI to understand natural language search queries and intelligently suggest matching items.

## Overview

Traditional filtering relies on exact text matching, which can limit the ability to discover relevant items when users enter descriptive phrases, incomplete keywords, or misspelled text.

This sample uses Azure OpenAI to analyze user intent and provide intelligent matching suggestions based on the meaning of the search query.

The AI-powered filtering engine considers:

- Natural language queries
- Spelling variations and corrections
- Semantic similarity
- Contextual relevance
- Related item names
- User intent

For example, users can search using phrases such as:

```text
healthy food

something spicy

vegetarian snacks

sweet dessert
```

Azure OpenAI interprets the search intent and returns the most relevant suggestions.

The filtered results are displayed directly in the Syncfusion® .NET MAUI AutoComplete, providing a smarter and more intuitive search experience.
